# Firewall Policy Analyzer And Optimizer

A comprehensive tool for analyzing and optimizing firewall rulesets, detecting anomalies like shadowed, redundant, and correlated rules. Features both CLI and web interface with AI-driven optimization capabilities.

## Key Features

- üïµÔ∏è **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies 5 types of rule conflicts:
  - Shadowing (SHD)
  - Redundancy (RXD/RYD)
  - Correlation (COR)
  - Generalization (GEN)
- ü§ñ **AI-Driven Optimization**: Expert system with rule-based optimization
- üìä **Interactive Web UI**: Streamlit-based interface with real-time analysis
- üîå **REST API**: Flask-based service for programmatic access
- üì¶ **Rule Management**: Supports CSV/JSON input and manual rule entry
